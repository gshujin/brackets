# brackets

A function that takes in a string consisting of the characters: *{}()[]. It will return True if it is possible to replace every * with one of the other characters to produce a string of correctly nested brackets and False otherwise.

For example, given the string ([*}]*, the function will return True as you can replace the first * with ] and the second * with ) to produce ([{}]), which is valid. 

If given another string [(*]]{}*, the function will return False as there is no way to produce a valid sequence of brackets.
